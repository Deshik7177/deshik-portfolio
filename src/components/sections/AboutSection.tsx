              Hey! Iâ€™m Paila Dhana Deshik â€” a Computer Science Engineer and tech explorer with a curious brain and robot-loving heart.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              I work at the crossroads of software and hardware â€” from building Flask/Django-based web apps to designing smart systems with Raspberry Pi. Iâ€™m currently deep into backend dev, AI/ML, and automation, and I love taking real-world problems and turning them into projects that.

              Outside the compiler, youâ€™ll probably catch me messing around in the Robotics Lab, obsessing over new tech, or trying to build something I barely understand...

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold font-headline text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">My Tech Journey</h3>
            <p className="mb-2">
              It all started back in 2018, when I was in 7th grade. My school introduced something called ATL â€” the Atal Tinkering Lab. That place changed everything.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              For the first time, I touched circuits, sensors, and microcontrollers. We werenâ€™t just studying science â€” we were building it. Thatâ€™s when I realized: tech wasnâ€™t just something you use... it was something you could create.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Then came 11th grade. Python entered the chat ðŸ“²<br/>
              Our Computer Science subject was all about Python and SQL, and thatâ€™s where I truly got into coding. Once I started writing code, I couldnâ€™t stop. I kept diving deeper â€” from simple logic problems to full-blown projects.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              College opened up a whole new world â€” <strong>web dev, AI, ML, NLP, cloud</strong>, and most importantly, <strong>robotics</strong>. Our college robotics lab became my happy place â€” a wild zone where hardware meets code and everything feels possible.

              Since then, I've been experimenting, failing, learning, and building â€” and honestly? Thatâ€™s the part I love the most.
