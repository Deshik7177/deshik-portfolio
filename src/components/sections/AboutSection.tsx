              Hey, Iâ€™m Paila Dhana Deshik â€” just a kid who walked into a school lab back in 7th grade and never looked back.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              My tech journey kicked off in 2018 when my school introduced something called the Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL) â€” a space filled with wires, circuits, sensors, and ideas waiting to come alive. Thatâ€™s where I first touched electronics and got a glimpse of what it means to build things that move, blink, and respond.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              By 11th grade, I got officially introduced to Python through my CS subject â€” and thatâ€™s where it all clicked. From writing basic scripts to exploring SQL databases, I found myself deep in the rabbit hole. I didnâ€™t just learn coding â€” I got hooked on solving real problems with logic and curiosity.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Fast forward to college â€” now Iâ€™m diving headfirst into the world of Web Development, AI, Machine Learning, and NLP, experimenting with everything I can get my hands on. But the real plot twist? I found my second home in my collegeâ€™s Robotics Lab. Thatâ€™s where hardware and code collide â€” and where I feel most alive.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              Right now, Iâ€™m exploring how code can interact with the real world â€” whether itâ€™s building smart systems with Raspberry Pi, training models to understand language, or creating fullstack apps that solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m not just chasing trends. Iâ€™m chasing impact.
