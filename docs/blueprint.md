## Core Features:

- Animated Hero: Hero section with profile picture and animated headline, transitioning between 'Fullstack Developer', 'Techie', and 'AI Enthusiast'.
- Interactive Bio: An About Me section, rendered as a timeline layout with education, experience and a brief bio (using Paila's supplied tech stack and background).
- Project Showcase: Projects section displaying a grid of project cards with title, tech stack tags, screenshot, and GitHub/demo links.
- Blog Teasers: Blog section featuring placeholder cards with title, short description, and 'Read More' buttons that are compatible with dynamic blog content fetched from the eventual Django + SQLite backend.
- Contact Hub: Contact form with fields for name, email, and message, and functional social media icon links. Mailto link (or a method easily adaptable to connect to Django later).
- Navigation Bar: Responsive, sticky navbar with smooth scroll to sections, and a dark mode toggle button.
- Extras: Favicon, SEO meta tags and a custom loading animation when the page first loads.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant neon blue (#52c7ea) to reflect Gen Z's energy and tech focus.
- Background color: Dark grey (#28292b) to enhance the neon blue, giving the interface a modern and sleek appearance.
- Accent color: Light blue (#78cdff) for highlights, emphasizing key UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif to ensure readability and align with the minimalist theme.
- Glassmorphism effect applied to panels/cards to create a modern, translucent frosted glass appearance. Will work very well with the color selections above.
- Subtle fade-in effects and hover animations using Framer Motion or CSS transitions.
- Line icons used throughout, keeping the UI clean and visually consistent.
